Welcome to the TigerGraph documentation site!
Here you can find the reference materials, guides, and examples to develop your application and scale your analytics with the power of graph.

== Legacy documentation site
Our new documentation site provides you with improved organization, more accurate search, as well as faster page loading. However, it only contains documentation for TigerGraph 3.2 and later.

To access the documentation for TigerGraph 3.1 or earlier, please visit our https://docs.tigergraph.com/legacy[legacy documentation site].

== Navigation and switch versions
On the left side of any page you can find a navigation menu to any component of the documentation site.

To switch to a different version, click the version number you'd like to proceed with in the left-side navigation.
