<h4 id="_q_how_does_tigergraph_cloud_compare_with_other_dbaas_offerings" class="discrete"><strong>Q:  How does TigerGraph Cloud compare with other DBaaS offerings?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A:  TigerGraph Cloud gets you up and running with the fastest and best price-performance graph platform in just minutes. TigerGraph&#8217;s native parallel graph and deep link analytics give you both speed and scale, even on the most complex tasks. The GraphStudio visual design interface enables everyone on your team to be a guru in graph. And our starter kits for popular use cases mean you can have an example graph application working in minutes. Since it requires far fewer machines to achieve high performance, TigerGraph&#8217;s price performance sets a new bar for the graph database industry.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="_q_how_do_i_migrate_to_the_new_december_2020_pricing_to_lower_my_bill" class="discrete"><strong>Q: How do I migrate to the new December 2020 pricing to lower my bill?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: New December 2020 pricing applies to new paid tier solutions provisioned after December 16th 2020. You can keep the old pricing if you keep your paid tier instances provisioned before December 16th, 2020 and keep its state (running or stopped). If you want to take advantage of the new pricing to lower your cost, you can migrate your workload to a newly provisioned instance, or simply start and stop the old instance. Note that TigerGraph Cloud accounts with valid credit cards are eligible for the paid tier migration. Please submit a support ticket for migration assistance.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="_q_are_there_free_tier_instances_or_free_credits_for_the_system" class="discrete"><strong>Q: Are there Free Tier Instances or Free Credits for the System?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: Yes,  in both instances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Free Credits:</strong> A $25 credit will be automatically granted to each new registered account. The free credits is valid for 30 days after initial use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Free Tier Instance</strong>: When you select an instance type, you will see that one instance type is designated as the Free Tier. For each registered account, you may provision one solution from the Free Tier. Free Tier instances do not include backup and do not include support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If no user activity is detected for more than one hour, TigerGraph may automatically stop a Free Tier instance. Users can manually restart the free tier instances from their cloud portal. After 7 days of inactivity, TigerGraph may terminate the inactive free tier instances. For additional information, see <a href="https://www.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-cloud-subscription-terms/">TigerGraph Cloud Terms</a>.</p>

<h4 id="_q_i_cannot_start_my_free_tier_instances_why_is_there_a_capacity_error_in_my_activities" class="discrete"><strong>Q: I cannot start my free tier instances. Why is there a capacity error in "My Activities"?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: <strong>Known Capacity Issues:</strong> Free Tier instances are provisioned on a common instance type in a data center region of the cloud provider (AWS). During the surge cloud usage period, such as the current global lockdown due to COVID-19, cloud providers across the globe are experiencing capacity issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible that when you provision a free tier instance, it will not provision successfully on the first try because of the peak usage in a certain region in the backend cloud platform (AWS).  Please be patient and try to provision in another region, or at a later time when there is enough capacity in the region. For any stopped free tier instances, when you restart the solution, it is possible that your solution cannot restart with a machine because of the capacity issue from the cloud provider. In this case, try to restart the solution at a later time when there are more machines available in the region of the cloud provider (AWS). In both scenarios, you can look at the log in "My Activities" and the capacity issue is logged. Submit a support ticket if the capacity issue persists.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To reserve an instance for guaranteed capacity, please submit a support ticket and contact <a href="mailto:sales@tigergraph.com">sales@tigergraph.com</a> to arrange a long term contract for reserved TigerGraph instances.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="_q_in_what_cloud_platforms_and_regions_does_tigergraph_operate" class="discrete"><strong>Q: In what cloud platforms and regions does TigerGraph operate?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: TigerGraph Cloud offers three cloud platform options: AWS, Azure and GCP. In AWS,  supported regions are: US-West-1 (N.Cal), US-East-1 (N. Virginia), EU-West-1(Ireland), EU-West-2(UK), EU-Central-1(Germany) and  AP-Northeast-1(Japan). In Azure, supported regions are: West US (California, US West), West Europe (Amsterdam, Netherlands), Central India (Pune, India), South India (Chennai, India). In GCP, supported regions are: Europe-West-2 (London, UK), US-West-1 (oregon, US).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More regions and platforms will be added soon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Q: Can I choose different versions of TigerGraph on TigerGraph Cloud?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: Yes. When you create a solution, you can choose the database version you would like to use. <em>**</em></p>
</div>
<h4 id="_q_does_tigergraph_cloud_support_distributed_databases" class="discrete"><strong>Q: Does TigerGraph Cloud support distributed databases?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: Yes. In the latest version of TigerGraph Cloud, you can provision a highly available TigerGraph cluster by entering 2 or 3 for the replication factor during the provisioning process. Replication factor of 2 and 3 are supported for TigerGraph V3.0+. For TigerGraph V2.6, only replication factor of 2 is supported. The configuration is active-active, meaning that all copies of the data are available to answer queries.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">

<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
HA systems must have a minimum of 3 instances. This means that the smallest supported cluster configuration for a replicated system for TigerGraph V3.0+  is one-way partitioning X three-way replication = three instances. In comparison, the smallest supported cluster configuration for a replicated system for TigerGraph V2.6 is two-way partitioning X two-way replication = four instances.

<h4 id="_q_what_type_of_server_should_i_use_for_my_data_size_and_workload" class="discrete"><strong>Q:  What type of server should I use for my data size and workload?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A:  Please see the section on pricing on our website at <a href="https://www.tigergraph.com/cloud/">www.tigergraph.com/cloud/</a>. For further assistance, contact TigerGraph at <a href="mailto:sales@tigergraph.com">sales@tigergraph.com</a></p>
</div>
<h4 id="_q_what_kind_of_services_do_i_get" class="discrete"><strong>Q: What kind of services do I get?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: TigerGraph Cloud includes automatic scheduled backup, built-in encryption and other security features, patching, replication and distributed database option.  In addition, you can now provision a distributed database as well as a replica cluster for high availability. As a cloud service, many of the administrative and operational tasks - for monitoring, restoring, upgrading, for example - are just a click away. In addition to operations and management for your TigerGraph databases, TigerGraph Cloud also offers Starter Kits to provide instant experience to various graph analytics use cases. The list of Starter Kits can be found here: _**_https://www.tigergraph.com/starterkits/</p>
</div>
<h4 id="_q_is_there_a_quota_for_the_number_of_solutions_i_can_provision_in_a_single_account" class="discrete"><strong>Q: Is there a quota for the number of solutions I can provision in a single account?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: Yes. For basic accounts with credit card billing, there is a limit of 160 vCPUs and 20 instances. A solution is one logical database, which may include several instances due to a distribution database configuration and replication. For accounts running exclusively on Free Credit and that have not yet entered a valid credit card, there is a limit of 16 vCPUs and two solutions. For each registered account (with or without a valid credit card), you may only provision one solution from the Free Tier. To allow more vCPUs and solutions, please contact TigerGraph at _**_<a href="mailto:sales@tigergraph.com">sales@tigergraph.com</a>.</p>

<p>TigerGraph Distributed Cloud offers eight different instances in AWS platform, ranging from 4 vCPUs with 7.5 GiB RAM, to 96 vCPUs with 768 GiB RAM. In Azure, TigerGraph Distributed Cloud offers seven different instances, ranging from 4 vCPUs with 16 GiB RAM, to 96 vCPUs with 672 GiB RAM. In GCP, TigerGraph Distributed Cloud offers seven different instances, ranging from 4 vCPUs with 16 GiB RAM, to 80 vCPUs with 640 GiB RAM. Larger graphs require more RAM. Higher performance calls for both more CPUs and more RAM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our <a href="https://www.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-cloud-pricing/">pricing table</a> gives initial recommendations for which instance to start with, if you know how much data you will be loading into the graph. We call the input data your "raw data". TigerGraph reorganizes your data into a graph, encoding and compressing it. We have assumed that your stored graph will be about 70% of the size of your raw data. This is a conservative estimate; it&#8217;s often smaller.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also need RAM for your graph querying and computation. Workloads vary considerably. In the pricing table, we recommend that your total RAM be about 1.5 times the maximum amount of raw data you think you will load.</p>

<h4 id="_q_what_is_a_solution" class="discrete"><strong>Q: What is a Solution?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: A TigerGraph Solution is a graph database image which can be deployed on a virtual machine instance.  Most solutions also come with a starter kit, a sample graph schema, sample data, and sample queries for a common use case, such as Recommendation Engine, Anti-Fraud, and Healthcare Analytics. In a newly provisioned solution, the data files are ready to be loaded, and the queries are ready to be installed.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="_q_is_there_a_warm_up_period_for_tigergraph_instances_and_solutions" class="discrete"><strong>Q: Is there a warm-up period for TigerGraph instances and solutions?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: When you provision or restart a solution, there will be a warm-up period for the machine instances and the disk attached to the instances. The larger the data size and the greater the number of instances, the longer the warm-up period will be.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="_q_what_is_the_difference_between_stopping_and_terminating_a_solution" class="discrete"><strong>Q: What is the difference between stopping and terminating a solution?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: When you stop a solution, you shut down the virtual machine instance. The TigerGraph database is frozen in its current state. Billing for that machine instance also stops. Scheduled backups also stop, but the backup copies are kept in EFS in AWS, Azure Files in Azure, and GCP Filestores in GCP. You will still incur charges for disk storage and backups when a solution is stopped. You can start the solution again. After a warm up period, the solution will return to its previous state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you terminate a solution, you will deprovision the virtual machine and the attached disk space. The solution is deleted according to the cloud platforms policies and cannot be recovered. A backup file, however, can be used to restore to a new solution within 15 days.</p>

</div>
<h4 id="_q_what_backup_options_are_available" class="discrete"><strong>Q: What backup options are available?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: TigerGraph Cloud offers full backups on a scheduled or on-demand basis. By default, backup is turned on when instances are running and will be done daily. There are four options you can choose from: backup daily, weekly, monthly, and ad hoc. In current version, the retention policy is to retain up to seven backups. Therefore, if you choose to backup daily; the retention of backup is for a week; if you choose to backup weekly, the retention of backup is for seven weeks; if you choose to backup monthly, the retention of backup is for seven months. if you want to perform an ad hoc manual backup when there are already seven copies of backups, you need to delete an older version of backup in order to save the most recent ad hoc copy. The maximum number of manual backups is six, as the platform always reserves one spot for scheduled backup. When a solution is stopped, backup in EFS, Azure Files and GCP Filestores will be charged for the time you have the solutions. Please see pricing for backup cost while your instance is stopped.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: Only single server solutions can be restored from the backup of another solution in the same account within the same cloud platform. Distributed and replicated cluster cannot be restored from the backup of another cluster in the same account.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="_q_what_password_do_i_use_for_backup_and_restore" class="discrete"><strong>Q: What password do I use for backup and restore?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: To perform an ad hoc backup, use the password of the tigergraph user of your solution. To restore from a previous backup, use the same password that was used to create the backup. This rule applies to restoring from a different solution in your account. All the backups of different solutions in your account can be found through the Admin Portal.</p>

<h4 id="_q_what_kind_of_replicas_does_tigergraph_cloud_support" class="discrete"><strong>Q: What kind of replicas does TigerGraph Cloud support?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A:  TigerGraph Distributed Cloud offers active-active replication, for increased availability and automatic failover.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A TigerGraph system with HA is a cluster of server machines which uses replication to provide continuous service when one or more servers are not available or when some service components fail. TigerGraph HA service provides loading balancing when all components are operational, as well as automatic failover in the event of a service disruption.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="_q_what_is_the_replication_factor" class="discrete"><strong>Q: What is the replication factor?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: Replication factor means how many copies of data are stored, each on a separate machine. The default HA configuration has a replication factor of two, meaning that a fully-functioning system maintains two copies of the data, stored on separate machines. TigerGraph Distributed Cloud currently supports your choice of replication factor of one (only one copy of the data, not recommended for critical systems)<strong>,</strong> two. or three if you choose TigerGraph v3.0.6+. If you choose TigerGraph v2.6.x, only replication factor of one or two are supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Limitation for TigerGraph v2.6.x:</strong> In TigerGraph Distributed Cloud, if replication is used, the total number of instances must be at least 3. For TigerGraph v2.6.x, If replication factor is 2, then the partition factor must be at least 2, for a total of 2x2 = 4 instances. For TigerGraph v3.0.6+, the configuration for a cluster with 1 partition and 3 replicas is supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Limitation for TigerGraph v3.1.1:</strong> This version only supports single server configuration.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="_q_what_is_the_partition_factor" class="discrete"><strong>Q: What is the partition factor?</strong></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A: Partition factor means the number of parts or components your graph data is split into, which also equals the number of instances that collectively store one copy of the full graph.  For example, if you select a partition factor of 3, each instance will hold approximately 1/3 of your data. Please read <a href="https://docs.tigergraph.com/admin/admin-guide/installation-and-configuration/ha-cluster#examples" class="bare">https://docs.tigergraph.com/admin/admin-guide/installation-and-configuration/ha-cluster#examples</a> for additional details about partitions and replications.</p>

<p>A: You can access the database through TigerGraph&#8217;s GraphStudio visual interface and through RESTful endpoints. Use RESTful endpoints to POST to TigerGraph solutions and develop applications. Please refer to the <a href="https://docs.tigergraph.com/dev/restpp-api">RESTful API User Guide</a>. To find the RESTful endpoints for queries created in GraphStudio, please read &#8220;<a href="https://docs.tigergraph.com/ui/graphstudio/write-queries#TigerGraphGraphStudioUIGuide-DeleteQuery-1">Show Query Endpoint</a>&#8221;. There is also a recorded webinar which demos the process in details: <a href="https://info.tigergraph.com/graph-gurus-24" class="bare">https://info.tigergraph.com/graph-gurus-24</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Here is the step-by-step instructions:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TigerGraph cloud enables <a href="https://docs.tigergraph.com/v/2.4/dev/restpp-api/restpp-requests#rest-authentication">REST&#43;&#43; Authentication</a> to securely connect TigerGraph Cloud solutions with your application through port 9000.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> [One time] Navigate to the TigerGraph solution&#8217;s Admin Portal,  and generate a secret from User Management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the URL for the solution is:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-text hljs" data-lang="text">https://SOLUTIONID.i.tgcloud.io:14240/admin/#/user-management</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and the generated secret is abcd1234 from Admin Portal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> [Need to renew every lifetime] Use the secret generated in step 1 to get a RESTPP token (for example, xyz789) using curl command. Note that the port is 9000.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is an example where you obtain a token with a lifetime of 1,000,000 seconds (11 days):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-text hljs" data-lang="text">curl -X GET 'https://SOLUTIONID.i.tgcloud.io:9000/requesttoken secret=abcd1234&amp;lifetime=1000000'Returning</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-text hljs" data-lang="text">{
  "code":"REST-0000",
  "expiration":1570727825,
  "error":false,
  "message":"Generate new token successfully.",
  "token":"xyz789"
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>  Now in your application, use the token in the REST call, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-text hljs" data-lang="text">curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer xyz789" 'https://SOLUTIONID.i.tgcloud.io:9000/graph/MyGraph/vertices/Account?limit=3'</code></pre>
